Given an integer N,

If N is not divisible by 3 then print −1,
If N is an odd multiple of 3 the print 1,
else if N is an even multiple of 3 then print 0.
Input:
The first and only line of the input contains and integer N.
Output:
Print −1, 0, or 1 as per the input, in a separate line.

Constraints
1≤N≤106
Sample Input 1:
24
Sample Output 1:
0
Sample Input 2:
15
Sample Output 2:
1
Sample Input 3:
16
Sample Output 3:
-1
EXPLANATION:
In the first example, 24/3=8. As 8 is even so we print 0.
In the second example, 15/3=5. As 5 is odd so we print 1.
In the third example, 16 is not divisible by 3, so we print −1.
